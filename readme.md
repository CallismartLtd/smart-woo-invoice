# Smart Woo Service and Invoice

Integrate powerful service subscriptions and invoicing directly into your online store! This plugin is born out of the need for a robust, cost-effective billing solution tailored for freelencers offering diverse services.

## Introduction

As a web developer, I struggled to find an affordable and comprehensive billing solution for my clients. Traditional options were often expensive and complex. This led me to develop the Smart Woo Service and Invoicing Plugin, a WooCommerce extension designed to streamline service subscriptions and invoicing within your online store.

## Features

- **Dedicated Product Type:** Introduced a new 'Service Product' type indexed on the WooCommerce product page.
- **Flexible Billing Cycles:** Set billing cycles, sign-up fees, and grace periods on dedicated products.
- **User Personalisation:** Empower customers to set their service names and other relevant data during the purchase (sign-up) process.
- **Effortless Management:** All orders for this product type are considered new Service Orders, allowing easy processing via the the plugin Service Orders page.
- **Automatic Invoice Generation:** At the end of each billing cycle, a new invoice is automatically created for service subscription renewal.
- **User-Friendly Pages:** Dedicated frontend pages for Service Management and Invoice Management for clients using shortcodes.
- **Admin Notifications:** Get notified of service purchases, renewals, expirations, and stay informed about your subscriptions.
- **Stats and Usage:** You are incharge, monitor subscription stats and usages right from the admin dashboard, your client will also be able to view same stats for transparency.

- **Prorate Service Subscriptions:** You have the option to prorate your subscription and reflect same in your invoicing system.
- **Service Subscription Migration:** Flexible options to allow clients to migrate from their current subscription to another right from their dashboard.

- **Mini containers:** Show Invoices and subscriptions of the current user in mini card or containers using shortcodes.
