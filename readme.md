# Smart Woo Service and Invoicing Plugin

Revolutionise your WooCommerce experience with the Smart Woo Service and Invoicing Plugin! This plugin is born out of the need for a robust, cost-effective billing solution tailored for web developers offering diverse services.

## Introduction

As a web developer, I struggled to find an affordable and comprehensive billing solution for my clients. Traditional options were often expensive and complex. This led me to develop the Smart Woo Service and Invoicing Plugin, a WooCommerce extension designed to streamline service subscriptions and invoicing within your online store.

## Features

- **Dedicated Product Type:** Introduce a new 'Service Product' type indexed on the WooCommerce product page.
- **Flexible Billing Cycles:** Set billing cycles, sign-up fees, and grace periods on dedicated products.
- **User Personalisation:** Empower customers to set their service names and other relevant data during the purchase (sign-up) process.
- **Effortless Management:** All orders for this product type are considered new Service Orders, allowing easy processing via the WooCommerce order edit page.
- **Automatic Invoice Generation:** At the end of each billing cycle, a new invoice is automatically created for subscription renewal.
- **User-Friendly Pages:** Two dedicated pages for Service Management and Invoice Management for clients.
- **Admin Notifications:** Get notified of service expirations and stay informed about your subscriptions.
